## About
An app that offers a free solution for recruiters seeking visual insights into their recruitment KPIs. It features a dynamic dashboard that allows filtering by language, location, gender, or company within a selected time range.

The sidebar menu not only enables filtering of the dashboard but also allows users to navigate to a database dataframe. Within this dataframe, users can select specific columns to view and search for particular values within each row.
An excell template is provided to test the app although any excell file with the columns "Fullname","Phone_Number" and "Email" will work. The columns doesn't have to follow any specific order.

The recommend columns to get all the kpis available in the app are:
Comments, Fullname, Email, Phone_Number, Address, DoB, Gender, Language, Source, Application_Date, Status, Recruitment_Stages, Company, Location, Decline_Reasons, Phone_Screen_Date, Harver_Test_Date, Interview_Date, Offer_Date, Hiring_Date, Payment_Date, Modification_Date
